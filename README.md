**Sorting Algorithm Project**

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Project!
This project focuses on the implementation of sorting algorithms in the C programming language, adhering to specific coding standards and best practices.

**Project Overview**

-Sorting Algorithms
The main objective of this project is to implement various sorting algorithms, such as Bubble Sort, using C.
These algorithms will be designed to sort arrays of integers in ascending order.
The project provides a hands-on opportunity to learn and practice sorting techniques.

-Coding Standards
To maintain code quality and consistency, we follow strict coding standards throughout the project.
These standards include using specific compiler options, following the Betty style guide, and avoiding global variables.
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs.

-Documentation
Clear and concise documentation is essential for code readability and maintainability.
The project includes a README.md file (the one you are currently reading) that provides an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and explanations of the implemented sorting algorithms.

**Project Structure**

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

0-bubble_sort.c: This file contains the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

0-O: This file includes the Big O notation for the time complexity of the Bubble Sort algorithm under different scenarios (best case, average case, worst case).

0-main.c: A sample main program used for testing the implemented sorting algorithms.

print_array.c: Contains the print_array function to print arrays.

print_list.c: Contains the print_list function to print linked lists.

sort.h: The header file includes function prototypes and necessary data structures.

**Getting Started**

To run and test the sorting algorithms, follow these steps:

.Compile the code using the provided compilation command:

     bash
     Copy code
     gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 0-bubble_sort.c 0-main.c print_array.c -o bubble
.Run the program:

     bash
     Copy code
     ./bubble
This will execute the sorting algorithm and display the sorted array, step by step.

**Big O Notation**

Understanding the efficiency of sorting algorithms is crucial.
The project includes Big O notation for the time complexity of the implemented Bubble Sort algorithm in various scenarios:

     Best Case: O(n)
     Average Case: O(n^2)
     Worst Case: O(n^2)
